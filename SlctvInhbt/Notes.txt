% Notes for Selective inhibition
% Bo Shen tried to find evidence of disinhibition from the dataset of
% Najafi et al., 2020
% Najafi, Farzaneh and Elsayed, Gamaleldin F and Pnevmatikakis, Eftychios 
% and Cunningham, John P and Churchland, Anne K (2018) 
% Inhibitory and excitatory populations in parietal cortex are equally selective for decision outcome in both novices and experts.

% The attempt failed because of the following reasons

% To find evidence of disinhibition from the spiking activities of cells with labeling of
% types (excitatory and inhibitory), there are at least two ways to do
% that:

% 1. To see whether the time course of inhibitory cells activities within
% response field bifurcate in the late stage of decision-making. As the
% prediction of LDDM, G and I activities to input stimuli goes the opposite
% direction in the late stage of decision-making because I inhibits G.
% However, such an idea is not able to conduct on the current dataset due
% to no labeling of 'response field' for any of the cells. It is hard to
% tell whether the bifucation is because of disinhibition or soley lateral
% inhibition.

% 2. The second way to proof is to see whether the coding in inhibitory
% cells exhibit switching of states from value coding to choice. During
% value coding, the G cells are supposed to be non-selective for inputs.
% They bifurcate in the decision phase, in an opposite direction as I
% cells. However, because of lacking labels of response field, what the
% model can predict is only the emergence of choice predictions on these
% cells, not specific as a prediction of disinhibition.

% 3. There might exist a population of inhibitory cells (G) that switch from non-selective
% coding of input stimuli (summed values) to selective coding of choice. Another
% population of inhibitory cells (I) that have no coding of summed input values
% but progressively exhibit coding of choice.
